As every time Valentine's Day approaches, and you find yourself single, as I ‘m, you may end up looking online for “the one.” I'm frequently asked if it's realistic that guys can find real love and [long-lasting relationships](/) on apps. The question is indeed common it's even made its way to pop culture; it is a central point in Hulu's new series Casual.

I have learned that the answer is yes and the reason I feel so passionately about this, is because I've heard so many success stories first hand. Many times I receive them through Facebook and other times I am approached at bars and nightclubs. In addition , I travel a lot as part of my job, so I am fortunate enough to befriend men across the U.S. and the world, who discuss beautiful, layered stories about meeting the loves of their life through what many might only categorize as a hookup app.

Seeing that when they describe a first meeting that led to something more genuine fire of love on someone's face has become one of my favorite elements of the occupation and it is incredibly fulfilling. I've even been able to keep in contact with a number of these couples and become close buddies. One asked me to ordain their wedding!

These stories kept popping up. Successes. Real, continuing, love. Our team was thrilled to hear these stories that we started featuring couples who met through our app directly on our Facebook page in a weekly nod to people who are searching for love! Just as you can stumble upon the love of your own life while wandering through your own neighborhood or workplace, it is totally possible that you can find it on an app also.

One amazing example is Mikey and AJ who had been chatting on the app for weeks until they eventually met for dinner. Based on Mikey, he said the instant he saw AJ across the street on 1st Avenue and their eyes met, it was love at first sight. Mikey said he was nervous but the beer, wings, and tater tots did the trick and they had a great dinner date. They will be wed soon and are now engaged!

Another couple, Tom and Jan, met while they were vacationing in Spain. Tom had come from Cologne from Jan and Paris, so when they met in person they assumed it'd be a one-time thing. Two months later, they were living in Paris and have now lived for more than a year!

Jacob's story and Osiel started with a WOOF. After Jacob received a WOOF from Osiel, they started chatting and made lunch plans. Osiel believed “lunch” actually meant a hookup. When the WOOFing Jacob arrived he proposed they go to Osiel's favourite taco eatery. Quickly forward and now they're engaged to be wed! If you are open to it therefore, a WOOF actually may bring about a significant relationship.

Since last Valentine's Day, we have been sharing the stories of more than 60 couples and they all are a testament to the truth that you absolutely can find love and relationships on apps. That said, there are a few strategies that work much better than others. When listening to these various stories, I can not help but detect some common motifs and so if you find yourself looking for love on an app — I Have come up with some hints that might prove helpful.

My first tip would be to be fair in your dating profile. A profile that is misleading is a sure way to ensure that your first date is your only date. Whenever someone tells me what they enjoy most about our use, they almost always mention that they can locate guys that are friendly and honest on it. Apps have made it easier than ever to join and locate the men you enjoy, so there's no need. It very well may stop you from finding that fellow Game of Thrones-loving, board-gaming bear you've always wanted!

Also give some consideration to the way you express your character in your own profile. Most programs give you lots of room to add details, and specificity helps someone get to know the real you while less can likewise be more. Sharing a picture that shows your face also helps; more messages are received by guys with face pics as their profile picture.

My second tip is to maintain an open mind when searching for love, as you may locate it when you least expect it and with someone you might not have considered your “type” in the first place. Many narratives begin with a hookup that results in a date, which then leads to a connection. As For Me, I Have had several hookups that have led to some excellent dinner dates and eventually camaraderie.

Amount three? It is possibly the hardest — however don't throw in the towel readily. Attempt not to be that person in an endless cycle of deleting then re-downloading relationship programs after becoming frustrated. Relationship can be actual work and it is easy to get burnt out on hooking up, so do not be so quick to give in.

Apps can provide one of the most effective ways to meet with other guys. There is this stigma that apps in the gay community are only for hookups, but I've seen guys who have built solid, long lasting relationships and gone onto become wed as an effect. Programs are helping men find , long lasting relationships that are meaningful despite spaces, age differences, and communities.
