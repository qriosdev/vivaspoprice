Your greeting introduces you to other callers, so don't be bashful! This really is your opportunity to share what is special about you. Relax and take your time, as the finest greetings get the most responses! Below are some hints for recording a greeting:

- Keep your tone favorable! Ladies are attracted to warmth and trust, remember to smile and so speak.
- Share your finest attributes, interests, and fires. Think about what will get you stand out to the women, and allow them to know!
- Most importantly, tell them what you're trying to find! When it is friendship, a relationship, or something sensuous, asking for whatever you would like is the best method.
- When you are done recording to make sure it's how you need it, listen to your greeting. You can record a fresh one whenever you would like, in case you would like to express something different.
