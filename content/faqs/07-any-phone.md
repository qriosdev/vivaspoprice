question: 'Can I use a membership from any phone?'
---

Yes, if you have a Paid Membership you may use it from any phone you wish. Your Membership will continue as long as you remain active. To keep your Membership active you need to log in and use your time. If your Membership is not being used for a period of 3 months or more, it will be deactivated without any refund.
