question: 'HOW CAN I START MEETING NEW PEOPLE?'
---

We don't hire people to use our system, everyone you hear is a real person seeking the same things you're. It is easy to start.

1. Call the DailyChatLine phone number.
2. Record a greeting which will introduce you to the other callers. When you save it, it plays to the other callers, letting them know you are on the line.
3. Then listen to greetings from some other callers. Hear someone you enjoy? Send them a message! They will message you too if someone's into you. It's possible for you to react to anyone (or everyone!) you need–it's always up to you.
4. Locate someone truly special? Invite them to join you for a live chat session if messages are flying like sparks! Your private chats are just that – private! Do not stress, folks can still send you messages while you're in a private chat. Once you've completed a live chat you will hear them.
