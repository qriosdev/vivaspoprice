question: 'How can I start chatting with new people?'
---

We don’t hire people to use our system, anyone you talk to on the phone is a real person seeking the same things you’re. It is easy to start.

1. Call our ChatLineMate phone number.
2. Record a greeting which will introduce you to the other people. When you save it, it plays to the other callers in our network, letting them know you are on the line.
3. Then listen to greetings from some other callers. Hear someone you enjoy? Send them a message! They will message you too if someone’s into your intro. It’s possible for you to interact with anyone (or everyone!) you need–it’s always up to you.
4. Found someone truly special? [Invite them to join you for a live phone chat session](/blog/tips-phone-sex-pleasure/) if messages are flying like sparks! Your private chats are just that – confidential and private! Do not stress, folks can still send you messages while you’re in a private chat. Once you’ve completed a live chat you will hear them.
