question: "It's so hard to find new chat lines with free trials these days. Do you know any?"
---

Free trials used to be a popular promotion offered by most of reputable phone chat lines. However, due to abuse many no longer offer callers free trials. Our chatline runs free trial promos from time to time to avoid abuse and still give random new callers an opportunity to try our service. You can call in now to check if we have a promo now as we donâ€™t usually announce it beforehand.
