question: 'What are things to say during phone sex? I have no idea. Can you help?'
---

That’s a good question that we receive often from our users. Here are some quick tips for you:

1. Make sure you get or give consent to avoid grey areas. You could say, “What do you think about phone sex? Is it something you’d be down for?”

2. Don’t be afraid to ask direct questions. It’d help avoid misunderstanding and embarrassing moments. You’d ask, “Does this turn you on?” or “Do you like what I’m saying right now?”.

3. Don’t quit phone sex too soon. Most people need to practice at least several times to get comfortable.

4. Eliminate all distractions during the act.

5. Don’t rush. Take it slow. Throw it words like “Yes!”, “More!”, or other words that feel natural to you.

6. Explain what you’re doing. Describe things in detail to another person.

7. Clearly communicate what you like.

8. If something is unclear add details to it yourself.

9. Be honest but gentle. If you don’t like something don’t be rude. Explain things calmly and direct the conversation away to things you like.

10. Feel free to fantasize. There is no limit in phone sex.
