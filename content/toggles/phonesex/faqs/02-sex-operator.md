question: 'How to become a phone sex operator?'
---

Practice. A lot of practice. The thing is there is no school or class to learn this so you’ll have to jump right into it and you’ll gain experience and learn about phone sex as you go. You could start by calling in free chat lines as a user and chat with sex operators to see how they approach things. Then make listings on sites like Talktome and wait for calls to come in. The most important thing is to be consistent. Stay active on the sites you have your profiles and make sure you’re available during peak hours. Keep practicing and you’ll become good at it eventually.
