question: "How to find a sex partner who I'd actually enjoy my time with?"
---

The short answer is, through trials and errors. You can never know for sure if you enjoy sex with someone until you actually do it. Luckily, you can find multiple partners pretty easily these days thanks to the internet and modern technologies. No need to go out to bars and night clubs wasting your time and money and second-guessing all the time.
