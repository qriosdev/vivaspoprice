It’s not new that women are complicated and can be very confusing. But their body language and actions don’t usually lie if you pay attention. Some obvious signs:

1. She wants to spend alone time with you.
2. She flirts with you a lot.
3. She touches your body all the time.
4. She responds positively to what you say.
