question: 'Are there free hookup websites requiring no payment?'
---

Yes, there are. Some of our sites have free offers that don’t require any payment. But totally free websites usually have a lot of issues such as low engagement rate, identity theft, hacking, scams, etc. That’s why Up For Fling recommends using premium sites because they’re much more secure and have solid commitment and engagement rates.
