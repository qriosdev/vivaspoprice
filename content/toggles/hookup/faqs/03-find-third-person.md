question: 'Can you recommend sites for couples to find a third person?'
---

Check out the sites listed on this page. There is a good chance youâ€™ll find someone down to be the third. Although there are niche sites specifically designed for couples to find a third person but those sites usually have a very small user base so your chance of finding someone you both like is much smaller.
