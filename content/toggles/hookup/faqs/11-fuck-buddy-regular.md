question: 'How to find a fuck buddy for regular meetups?'
---

We get this question a lot and can say that many of our users actually find several people they enjoy their time with and usually arrange something on a regular basis with those people. Itâ€™s a win-win because you can always hit someone one quickly and have backup options if one or two of them are busy. If everyone is busy, well, you always have Up For Fling where you can get a new round of fun anytime.
