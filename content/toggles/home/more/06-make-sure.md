title: 'How to make sure things go the way I want it?'
---

So, we’ve done the deed once, and now we want to keep getting it on with the person in the foreseeable future. First of all, we’ll need to ensure that the fuck buddy system doesn’t turn into the “this could turn into something real” pitfall. To keep our new lover close (but still at arm’s length), we’ll need to do a couple of things.

**#1 Communicate That This Relationship Isn’t Going Anywhere**

We need to make our plans and wishes crystal clear from the very get-go. That way, both parties will know what they’re getting themselves into and won’t try to make the hookup into something else.

Moreover, we shouldn’t lead the other person on and make them think that there’s a possibility of a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship. After all, it’s not fair toward them and could get us into a heap of trouble.

**#2 Keep Things Casual at All Times**

Sadly, there often comes the point in a fuck buddy relationship where one person wants to take things to the next level. If we’re that person, we might be in dire need of a reality check. First of all, if we have already agreed on the type of arrangement, we can’t blame the other person for wanting things to stay the same. We can’t force anybody to enter a serious relationship with us — and why would we want to?

However, if we’re the ones being pushed to take the plunge, there are things we can do to get our fuck buddy system back on track. Believe it or not, many people will lose interest in a topic if we ignore them long enough. So if we just dodge the question every time the other person brings it up, they’ll probably give up after a while.

We could also try explaining to the person that this arrangement is what they signed up for and that we like the things as they are. To avoid insulting the other person (and losing the fuck buddy for good), we should try to be as gentle as possible. There’s no need to be an a-hole and tell them they’re not good looking or smart enough for us to be with them for real.

Instead, we can simply tell them that the relationship isn’t meant to be for X, Y, Z reasons. Also, even though “it’s not you, it’s me” excuse might seem like it’s been used to death, it can be quite effective. Finally, we shouldn’t lead the person on by making them think there’s even a possibility of a relationship.

**#3 Don’t Get Too Familiar**

Sure, we all have our deep-seated insecurities. But when it comes to our fuck buddy, they have no business dealing with them. If we need someone to talk to, we can hire a therapist or whine to our friends and cat — never the person we’re casually fucking.

Honestly, no one likes a desperate person; it’s not at all attractive, and it might put our fuck buddy off for good. Keeping things simple is crucial, and that means steering away from serious topics. They’re there to have sex and have a good time, not hear someone’s whole life story.

**#4 No Excessive Messaging**

Almost nothing kills a person’s libido in a way that a constant texter does. Overtexting can come off as needy, desperate, and overbearing — not hot, sexy, or fuckable.

Also, as this relationship is quite casual, there’s no need to talk to each other all day every day. An easy way to deal with this is to remember the 1:1 rule.

Unless you’re in a sex-related emergency, don’t text until they do. Also, don’t ask how their day was or send three consecutive messages to get them to answer. Yes, even if it means waiting things out for a few days to get an answer from the other person. If we forego this rule, we’ll come off as a needy, clingy douche that needs constant attention and affirmation.

**#5 Avoid Involving the Fuck Buddy Into Our Lives**

Our fuck buddies have no business knowing any other personal part of our lives — including friends and family. Above all else, we cannot under any circumstances purposely introduce the person to our parents. This act could result in our fuck buddy freaking out and ending the arrangement for good.

If we run into our parents while with our fuck buddy, we can introduce them only as a friend. Our moms and dads don’t need to know what this relationship is and what it consists of — and that would likely lead to a lecture anyways.

Overall, we mustn’t make them expect something more from the relationship by introducing them into our lives.

**#6 No Barebacking Allowed**

The only thing more frightening than having an AIDS scare is actually getting the disease. So anyone who’s passionate about having hot stranger sex, especially with multiple partners, needs to wrap up. It’s the year 2020, people, and by now, we should all know that wearing a condom is a must.

This simple product will help you steer clear of a plethora of sexually transmitted diseases. Do things like gonorrhea, pubic lice, chlamydia, or genital warts sound like fun? No? In that case, let’s just all wear a condom during our sexcapades.

We should only make an exception if we have a regular fuck buddy that isn’t bumping uglies with anyone else. Even then, both partners should be tested for STDs and wait for the results to come back as clean before climbing on top of each other.

However, just because we can avoid contracting an STD doesn’t mean we’re home free. As the other biggie that could ruin your hookup (and more) is an unplanned pregnancy.

**#7 Planning Ahead vs. Planned Parenthood**

Even when both partners are healthy, contraception still needs to be a part of the equation. Those who think that the “pull out method” is an effective one should be ready for the gut-wrenching trip to Planned Parenthood.

Instead, a woman can get an IUD, “the pill,” or other types of birth control to prevent pregnancy. There’s also a birth control pill for men, known as the Dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU) that decreases the production of sperm. Additionally, those who never want to experience the “I am your father” meme first hand could even get a vasectomy.

Even though abortions are still legal in most states in the U.S., they truly are the last resort. The experience won’t be a pleasant one for either party and will probably cause the two of you to part ways. Also, getting an abortion is incredibly expensive and stressful and will ruin your sex life for a while.
