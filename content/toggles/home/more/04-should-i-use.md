title: "I don't have problem picking up girls, why should I use this site?"

If you possess good social skills and have no problems with picking up women at bars, clubs, and other social settings, then you should definitely keep doing that. Nothing should stop you from conquering new territories. But if you need some help or want to simply skip all the hard work of common social interactions such as going out, buying drinks, having dinners, etc. you can use one of the online dating sites or download a casual hookup app and begin your journey of sex on-demand in the comfort of your home. And the cool thing is you can do it anytime you want during the day. To go to a bar, for example, you’ll need to wait until the right time of the day. No hot girls go to bars in the middle of the day unless they’re alcoholics. You’d want to avoid that potential drama.
