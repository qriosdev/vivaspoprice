No worries.

There’s a certain level of finesse that goes into finding a fuck buddy and keeping the relationship going long-term. Sadly, not everyone’s born with the knowledge (or even the faintest idea) of what to do in these situations. But no need to worry — for those who want to use a hookup app to find a fuck buddy, here’s what you need to do.

There is a right and wrong way of going about things on casual sex sites/apps to get lucky. Naturally, we’ll need to invest some time and effort in order to present ourselves in the best possible light. So here are a few things to keep in mind that will ensure we get action, possibly even attract a great fuck buddy:

**Tip #1 — Look Fuckable in the Picture**

The profile picture is the first impression we’re going to make on a would-be sex buddy. So perhaps the most important thing to do is show our face in it and look as fuckable as possible. There’s no need to make douchey or funny faces, or, God forbid, use a group photo to introduce ourselves.

Also, people tend to be attracted to those who are smiling or showing off a sexy smirk on their photo. Of course, that isn’t necessary, but if it increases the likelihood of us getting laid, why not do it?

Another thing that should go without saying but that some people probably need to hear is the following — don’t put a dick pic for your profile picture. Honestly, no one wants to see that before even knowing what the person’s face looks like. It comes off as cocky, and most potential fuck buddies will likely swipe left and never look back.

Finally, we should all have our trusted friends approve the profile picture we’re planning on using. Thanks to a misguided sense of confidence, we could end up picking a photo that will never get us laid. We can even have our friends “smash or pass” potential profile pics and decide on the best one.

**Tip #2 — There’s a Time and a Place for a Dick Pic**

Some of us think that sending a nude or a dick pic is the quickest way of getting action. However, we could hurt our odds of getting the Twinkie stinky by sending a risqué photo too quickly. So there’s no need to introduce ourselves with a dick pic, and more often than not, a simple “Hello” will suffice.

Still, there are some instances that call for a dick pic or a nude, especially if someone asks for it. When that time comes, here are the do’s and don’ts of sending the perfect picture of the mister:

- Include the whole face and body in the shot — This might sound a bit risky, but the receiver will appreciate it more, and the photo will likely look better.
- Find the best angle and lighting — There’s no need to tuck the balls and only include our penis. Yes, it’s the star of the show, but people might think that there’s something wrong with our anatomy and block us.

**Tip #3. — Be Wary of the Ones Looking for a Commitment**

People use dating apps for all sorts of reasons, such as looking for friends, life partners, or just a conversation. Also, while some people use sexy images and language to attract more hits, they might not want to hit that ass. Additionally, there are some who want a low-key way of advertising their… services — which they charge for.

Because of all of that, weeding out the choices and finding our fuck buddy isn’t always straightforward. Still, we should always make our intentions clear from the get-go and be on the lookout for any red flags. That leads us to our next topic — what do we do about the crazies on these hookup apps?

**Tip #4. Stay Safe**

Let’s face it — the world is full of weirdos. However, there’s a thin line between being a bit kooky and being full-on insane and biting someone’s penis off.

The issue here is that the internet offers a safe space for these people, as it gives them the ability to disguise themselves. Thus, they’ll be able to trick us into a fall sense of security and put us in a dangerous situation.

So we need to do everything we can to ensure we’re safe during each casual hookup. First of all, we should let our friends know where we’re going, who we’re meeting with, and when we should be back home.

Also, it’s always a good idea to keep mace on our person when going to a sketchy part of town. Alternatively, we could also carry a deodorant so that we don’t stink during our hookup — and protect ourselves if we need to.

**Tip #5. Nobody Wants to Do the Creep**

Some people just ooze creepiness, and this quality tends to bleed into their online personas. Still, we have to find ways of not coming off as creepy because it can prevent us from ever getting laid.

A good rule to remember is — if we even have to ask ourselves whether we’re being creepy, we are. We could also take some notes from Real Social Dynamics (RSD) videos until we learn to act normal. If all else fails and we still must creep, it’s best to channel this energy onto the people we don’t plan on taking to bed.

Now that we know how to act on hookup apps, one question still remains. What do we need to do after the encounter in order to keep boning on a regular basis?
